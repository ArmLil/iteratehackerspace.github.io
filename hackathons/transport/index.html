	   # Problem
	   -----------

	   1. Transportation is either inconvenient, expensive or both.
	   2. Urban transportation is only increasing, costs are increasing.
	   3. Resources are underutilized, or misallocated.
	   4. Time is incresingly valuable, especially for the urban professional class.

	   # Solution 
	   ----------

	   On demand services are our new reality, they make sense from several fronts
	   including business, environment and economic (Think of Uber)

## ResquaredNow
---------------
We created an complete end to end transportation renting service
featuring a mobile ordering system, `iOS`, `Android`, 
and a custom Facebook chatbot service.

Our customers can order an electric bicycle or car on their terms, their time
and most importantly with complete convenience

## Business Model
----------------
Our target customers are urban professionals, people who are 
happy to pay for either a subscription service or hourly rental 
of a car or electric bicycle and don't need to drive more than say 20 KM 
or just need a car for less than 24 hours.

We have minimum overhead, no physical offices, very few staff. We also optimize 
the locations of our vehicle in realtime and adjust to market forces
with dynamic pricing, import for the upcoming summer season in tourist heavy 
cities. (Think upcoming Diaspora Summer Season in Armenia)

### Purchase flow
--------------
1. Customer registers with our service via our mobile application, 
dedicated website or even with our Facebook chat bot.
2. Customer comes to our cars located in algorithmically placed locations
(Explained in the technical overview)
3. Customer knows at all times their utilization of our vehicle, in a car
they see the KM used, hours left and cost of extension in realtime with our
mobile application, `iOS` features a `Apple Watch` extension.
4. Customer returns the car or continues their rental with possibly an 
updated price dependent on market forces (Surge pricing)

	   ### Business Model Cont...
	   -------------------------
	   For our business model to work, we need to be ruthless in 
	   constantly optimizing data and key metrics.

	   1. We need to know which lots of inventory need to 
	   stay full and which can be low, or completely closed in off season

	   2. We need to have real time information from our vehicles, to verify that 
	   customers are indeed driving less than a preallocated amount of KM, 
	   not abusing the cars.

### Business Model (Technical side) Cont...
-------------------------
For `1`, we use the data provided by `GG` taxi and 
some Machine Learning algorithms, Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, 
to know which inventory lots need to be kept full. For example, if people are tending 
to order many cars in Kentron from Amiryan, then logically we should keep our inventory there stocked up.
We can ascertain this because `GG`'s data provided the geographic origin of taxi orders

### Business Model (Technical side) Cont...
-------------------------

Our partnership with `Wicastr` provides us with real time metrics
from the vehicles, specifically KM added, gas remaining, and the 
health of the car writ large. `Wicastr` provides us with independent
self hosting internet nodes which can communicate to our backend services, 
all in real time.

Each car gets a dedicated `Linux`, `nodejs` server connected to our own ad-hoc, 
secure, encrypted internet.

	   ### Technical Details
	   -------------------
	   For this hackathon we implemented:

	   1. A live server to handle the chatbox functionality: `IBM Watson`, `Bluemix`, `FB API`, `nodejs`
	   2. A second live server to handle the web application and 
	   real time communication with connected clients: `nodejs`
	   3. An `iOS` and `Android` native application: `ReactNative`
	   4. A web application connected to 1-3:`ReactJS`, `WebSockets`
