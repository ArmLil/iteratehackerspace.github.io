# More Networking -- UDP, Multicast

## _Protocols_
--------------
The previous example we did made some assumptions.
We assumed a kind protocol, that is we assumed HTTP because
we wrote

```
GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:example.com\r\n\r\n
```

to the other computer. The HTTP protocol says
that a HTTP request has the request line,
HTTP headers and possibly a body. You can read the offical `HTTP1.1`
spec [here](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html).
`HTTP2` is gradually being [adopted](https://http2.github.io/)․
	  </script>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Routing_
-----------
`HTTP` is usually implemented with TCP because this kind of protocol
needs to know whether data has been successfully transfered. Like you want
to be sure that you're getting the full picture on the website and such.
TCP is a routing, (routing means an algorithm for deciding how to send data across
different computers)․
	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Routing cont..._
-----------
In a simplified understanding:
TCP does it this sending an acknowledgement whenever one side
gets the data.

```
A
  \  (Here A sends the message to B)
    \ -> -> -> -> -> -> -> -> -> -> -> -> -> B
                                          /
(And B sends back a message              /
to A saying it got the data)            /
A <- <- <- <- <- <- <- <- <- <- <- <- <-
```
This is a kind of overhead to the protocol, the cost is resource usage
overhead but the benefit is knowing that data has or hasn't been transferred
successfully.

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Routing cont..._
--------------------
Sometimes we care more about performance, we just want to
send as much packets as possible to the other computer without
caring if the other computers got it or not. In cases like that
we use another protocol called `User Datagram Protocol`,
[`UDP`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol)․
	  </script>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Routing cont..._
--------------------
`UDP` is a protocol which just sends the data without
caring if the other side, the other computer getting the data,
got the data or not. This means that if you use just UDP, then
you might experience data loss.

There are a few domains where we might care more about just getting
as much data across than if all the data got there, that is
we are okay with losing some packets.

Examples of UDP usage include: Skype and other VOIP, Online Multiplayer
games, and YouTube video streaming.

	  <script type="text/template">
## _Multicasting_
-----------------
Often we don't just want to send messages to one computer but to
many computers. With TCP we are directly talking to one computer
but that comes with some overhead. UDP lets us efficiently send messages
to everyone on a network without checking if they got it or not with
some called `Multicast`

```
                                               ----------
                                              | Computer1 |
                                             / ----------
 --------          -------------------------/   ----------
| Sender |------> | Multicast Group/Network |--| Computer2 |
 --------          -------------------------\   -----------
                                             \  -----------
                                              | Computer..N |
                                                -----------

## _Multicasting Chat Cont..._
-------------------------
We can easily do it in `node`, run script on two different
computers on the same network. (`dgram` means datagram)
```
"using strict";

const multicast_addr = "224.1.1.1";
const port = 6811;

const udp = require("dgram");

const listener = udp.createSocket({type:"udp4", reuseAddr:true});
const sender = udp.createSocket({type:"udp4", reuseAddr:true});

listener.bind(port, multicast_addr, () => {
  listener.addMembership(multicast_addr);
  listener.setBroadcast(true);
});

listener.on("message", function (b, other) {
  console.log(b.toString().trim());
});

process.stdin.on("data", function (data){
  sender.send(data, 0, data.length, port, multicast_addr);
});
```
	  </script>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Multicasting Chat Cont..._
-------------------------
This should look like pretty standard node code, we establish
some handlers for events. For data input we just read from `stdin`
which means we'll just give the input via the terminal.

Basically we sent a message to a "group" on the local network and
whoever is listening to that group will get the message. While with
TCP we know who received the message, that is we can get an IP address
from the other side, with multicast we don't know who got the message
with just the protocol.

	  <!-- We make a protocol idea for chat client project -->
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Multicasting Chat Cont..._
------------------------------
This is a pretty bare bones client, but it does work. One thing that
you might have noticed is that there is a duplication of messages
printed. This is because the sender is also a receiver so you
also get the message that you send out. As an application this is
a bug, since application logic should have you duplicate messages on
the screen.

HINT: This will be your project improvement.

## _Multicasting Chat Cont..._
------------------------------
Another thing that you might have noticed is that its kinda ugly!
There's no aesthetic, no instructions, no identification of who is
talking. Remember, this is multicast so everyone can say anything
as much as they want and you won't know who said it unless they tell
you.

HINT: This is another area of project improvement.

## _Making Multicasting Chat Pretty..._
---------------------------------------
Remember the `htop` program? It's a terminal program which told us
about all the processes on the computer. `htop` uses something
called `ncurses`, a hard to use `C` program. Because we are using node
we have the entire `npm` ecosystem available to us!

The library you can use for terminal UI coding is
called [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) and another library
which lets you do dashboards called
[blessed-contrib](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib)

HINT: You will use `blessed-contrib` for a project.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _Multicasting Chat Protocol_
-------------------------------
Now let's address the other problem of duplication of message.
We need to create a protocol which every implementation client of our
chat will need to implement.

Recall that the problem of duplication is that we don't know about the
identity of who sent a message, this kind of logic needs to be implemented
at the application level, that is our code. We can formalize that
as a protocol, an agreed upon way of communicating, just like `HTTP` is a
protocol built on top of `TCP/IP`, so we can also invent our own protocol
on top of `UDP`.

	  </script>
	</section>

	<section data-markdown>
	  <script type="text/template">
## _ISTC-SPEAK Protocol_
-------------------------------
Let's invent a protocol called `ISTC-SPEAK`. It՛s a simple,
JSON based protocol on top of UDP.

Here's its description:

```
port := 6881
# The ping message must be sent out once every 25 seconds
msg ping := {identifier : String, uptime : Number }
msg message := {identifier : Number, payload : String}
```
<small>
`ISTC-SPEAK` is made up of only two kinds of messages, `ping`
and `message`. Each needs to have an `identifier` field of type
`String`, `ping` has an extra field saying how long the sender
has been running for and `message` has an extra field of the actual
message that the sender wants to share with everyone on the multicast
network. Ping needs to be sent out every 25 seconds, so that clients
can somewhat reliably know who is on the network.
</small>
	  </script>

	  <script type="text/template">
## _Group Project for rest of class_
------------------------------------
Now we'll do a group project, in your own teams, you'll
implement a `ISTC-SPEAK` client. There are three requirements
of this project.

1. It must correctly implement the `ISTC-SPEAK` protocol
2. It must be aesthically pleasing and use either `blessed` or the
   `blessed-contrib` library. Look at the example code in their
   respective repos.
3. It must use `Promises`, that will be explained in the next lecture.
